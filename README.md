Pico Pi based synthesizer

- Digital Oscillator (DCO) using wavetables
- Analog Filter (VCF) control (I use filter in my EuroRack, next i will try to build a filter based on CEM3340, examples:  https://electricdruid.net/cem3320-filter-designs/
- Pico Audio Pack from: https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-audio-pack
- 12 Bit DAC MPC 4725 to create CV Control Voltages  to drivea Filter : https://www.adafruit.com/product/935
- Midi Control using a Midi Beakout Board: https://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/audio-midi/midi-breakout
- Hexler Touch OSC UI on IoS:  https://hexler.net/products/touchosc
- Uses low cost Pico Pi 
- Low latency, low jitter, faster than a Linux based system
